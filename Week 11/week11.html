            <h2>The Sensor Journey</h2>
            <p>In my quest to create custom sensors for my final project, I embarked on an extensive internet deep dive that led me to some fascinating discoveries. After hours of research, I stumbled upon a groundbreaking paper from Harvard's Wyss Institute that detailed an innovative approach to creating stretchable capacitive sensors.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>The paper described a simple yet elegant solution: two conductive fabrics separated by an insulating layer. When the insulator stretches, it becomes thinner, bringing the conductive layers closer together and increasing the capacitance. This principle seemed perfect for my needs, and I immediately began designing my own version.</p>

            <h3>Initial Research and Materials</h3>
            <p>Before diving into the design process, I spent several days researching different types of conductive fabrics and insulating materials. I tested various combinations of conductive threads, copper tape, and different types of stretchable insulating materials. The goal was to find materials that would maintain their conductivity while being flexible enough for the glove application.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
            <p>I spent several days designing and laser-cutting multiple iterations of the sensor. Each design was carefully tested to ensure it would work effectively with my glove interface. The first few attempts were too rigid, while others were too sensitive to external interference. After numerous iterations, I finally developed a design that balanced flexibility with reliability.</p>

            <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
            <p>The testing phase was extensive. I created a simple Arduino setup to measure the capacitance changes and recorded data for different stretching scenarios. I tested the sensors under various conditions - different temperatures, humidity levels, and stretching patterns. This helped me understand the behavior of the sensors and identify potential issues.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>To my delight, all the designs worked! The sensors responded to stretching as predicted, creating measurable changes in capacitance. However, this success brought new challenges to light.</p>

            <h3>Integration Challenges</h3>
            <p>The main challenge I'm facing is the placement of these sensors on the glove. Currently, I've attached them to the inside of the fingers, where they stretch naturally with finger movement. While this works, there are two significant concerns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sensors are quite noisy, requiring careful signal processing</li>
                <li>The fingers need to stretch the sensors significantly to produce meaningful changes in the readings</li>
            </ul>

            </figure>

            <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
            <p>Looking ahead, I'm considering several improvements to address the current challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing a more sophisticated signal processing algorithm to reduce noise</li>
                <li>Experimenting with different sensor geometries to increase sensitivity</li>
                <li>Testing alternative placement strategies on the glove</li>
                <li>Exploring different conductive materials that might provide better signal-to-noise ratios</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These challenges are not insurmountable, but they do require careful consideration in the next phase of development. I'm currently exploring ways to improve signal quality and optimize the sensor placement for better responsiveness.</p>
