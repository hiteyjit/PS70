            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Hiteyjit, a sophmore at Harvard, concentrating in Neuroscience, and passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity. Through PS70, I've been exploring the fascinating world of digital fabrication and engineering design.</p>
            <p>I have had a background in robotics since childhood but recently pivoted towards Neuroscience during my undergraduate studies. I, frankly, became obsessed with the idea of learning about the unknowns in our brain, and ended up wanting to study it on a much deeper level.
                However, even though I am truly passionate about Neuroscience, the idea of combining my background in robotics with my new skills in Neuroscience is an itch I would love to scratch.</p>
            <p>A lot of exploration at this interesection occurs here, whether it be through labs or classes, and this is an opportunity I would not like to miss. This is why I am taking PS70, it is a stepping stone into me being able to think in ways to combine both my passions of robotics and neuroscience.</p>
            <p>Some other fun facts about me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I LOVE sleep</li>
                <li>I love to watch Formula 1</li>
                <li>I love to fly my drone (which I recently crashed :(( )</li>
                <li>I make films (India trip video coming soon)!</li>
                <li>I enjoy photography!</li>
