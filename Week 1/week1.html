        <h3>This week we had an introduction to the lab, the class, syllabus elements, what CAD software we'll be using, what trainings we had to do, and how the rest of this semester will be structured.</h3>
        <h3>We also split off into groups and started discussing project ideas - there were some really cool projects that I'm excited to see all of us make progress on!</h3>
        <h3>And last but not least, we started to get a hold of how to make our basic personalized websites!</h3>

            <h2>Website Creation</h2>
            <p>Bobby was extremely helpful in orienting us with GitHub and how to simulate our websites on it. We then used the template on the PS70 website to create a basic layout of our own website.</p>
            <p>I was excited to start making a unique design for the website but I was not sure how. When I was discussing some potential design ideas with those sitting around me, one of my peers recommended a particular software that ended up becoming highly useful: Cursor AI</p>
            <p>Although I have basic HTML and CSS knowledge, I was still a little unsure about how to tie it all together. Cursor came to my aid for this. I was able to ideate some of my thoughts and was able to get a good functioning website based by using some AI assistance to translate the more complex design ideas I had into actual code (eg. the glowing grid on the index.html page, the floating photo on the aboutme.html page, etc).</p>
            <p>I was able to implement a minimalist-looking design with high contrast colors (black and white), and particularly wanted to implement elements such as the boxes for each week (on the index.html page), responsiveness to icons being hovered over, and an eye-catching electronic-looking grid system right at the top. These were some initial designs I wanted to put on the website, and I will probably put some more over the course of this semester as well (perhaps even a different cursor from before, similar to what someone from a previous term did).</p>
            <p>Here's a screenshot of how I was able to use some of the prompts to create some cool features:</p>

            <h2>Idea 1: An Electric Skateboard</h2>
            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Project Planning Image">
            <p>I walk a lot. Especially on campus here, it is inevitable that if you do not have a bike, you end up walking a few ten thousand steps a day. I wanted to see if there was a way to avoid this much walking (if you can't tell, I do not like walking at all). There are, of course, obvious options such as getting a bicycle, or a skateboard, or getting a scooter. But, all of these also require some form of effort to get around, and something like a normal skateboard may not be so forgiving on the rough salt-laden walkways during the wintertime. Me being the lazy person I am, wanted to find an alternative</p>

            <p>I remember watching one of my favorite YouTubers, Casey Neistat, use something called a Boosted Board. It is essentially an electric longboard, with a wireless remote control, that could take him from one point to another in (almost) any condition and on any surface. I have always loved the idea of a Boosted Board, but was not able to ever buy one after seeing how much they cost. This is why one of my PS70 ideas was to make one myself. I would love to be able to create a cost-effective electric skateboard that could take me around campus with ease.</p>

            <p>My basic ideation included breaking down this project into the most basic pieces it would need to work:</p>
            
            <p><strong>An actual board to attach components to</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is probably the most simple thing in this project. This would require simple woodworking & wood cutting to create a large longboard/skateboard shape cut into a thick piece of wood (design in image). It would likely be done using the laser cutting machine or potentially the CNC machine.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>A form of remote control transmission and receiveerr</strong></p>
            <p>There were a few ways I could approach the remote control transmission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a regular RC-car remote control which has a trigger mechanism to accelerate or decelerate (image)</li>
                <li>Create a 'glove' device that would sense if I've clenched my fist or not to accelerate or decelerate the board</li>
                <li>Bobby suggested that this idea could be awesome even on its own, so I've ideated further below</li>
                <li>The receiving component, in theory, should be pretty simple, as it can just be be a microcontroller unit on the board that receives a continuous numerical input from the remote control, and increases the voltage fed to the motors with an increase in input, and a decrease in voltage with a decrease in input (to speed up/slow down the board, respectively)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Motors & Trucks Interaction Mechanism</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This would be the most essential component to make this an actually useful skateboard. Traditionally, many electric skateboards use a motor placed inside the wheel itself, so when a signal is sent, these motors are able to directly move the wheels (image attached). These motors simply rest on the trucks of the skateboard and spin freely on them (much like a regular skateboard).</li>
                <li>This is an easy approach to making the skateboard, especially if one could acquire the motors parts. However, this is exactly the issue: motors that output high enough power to move a human body (>500W) are quite expensive to buy, and couple that with needing to be housed within skateboard wheels, the price increases even more.</li>
                <li>An alternative method would be to use a system of gears to indirectly spin the wheels of a skateboard. The wheels would be placed on specially designed axles, somewhat taking inspiration from a car's differential system (image), enabling a singular motor to spin both wheels. However, this too, requires a powerful motor, bringing up the issue of cost.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>A Battery</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Along with the actual motors, a method to power them would also be required. This would need to be quite powerful (24V-48V, 5Ah-10Ah), making them quite big. This would mean either attaching them to the bottom of the skateboard, or towards the back of the skateboard. However, the required power specification of these batteries makes the cost quite high, adding an additional barrier.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A commonly recurring theme here is cost. The cost to simply acquire the raw materials is quite high. Although the anticipated cost may still be lower than that of buying an actual electric skateboard, it is still quite out of my budget. Unless I am able to find some form of cheap alternative to these issues, this idea might not come to fruition.</p>
