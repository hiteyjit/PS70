        <h3>This week we had an introduction to the lab, the class, syllabus elements, what CAD software we'll be using, what trainings we had to do, and how the rest of this semester will be structured.</h3>
        <h3>We also split off into groups and started discussing project ideas - there were some really cool projects that I'm excited to see all of us make progress on!</h3>
        <h3>And last but not least, we started to get a hold of how to make our basic personalized websites!</h3>

            <h2>Website Creation</h2>
            <p>Bobby was extremely helpful in orienting us with GitHub and how to simulate our websites on it. We then used the template on the PS70 website to create a basic layout of our own website.</p>
            <p>I was excited to start making the website, and was discussing some potential design ideas with those sitting around me - and one of my peers recommended a particular software that ended up becoming highly useful: Cursor AI</p>
            <p>Although I have basic HTML and CSS knowledge, I was still a little unsure about how to tie it altogether to create a good design. Cursor came to my aid for this. I was able to ideate some of my thoughts and was able to get a good functioning website based by using some AI assistance to translate the more complex design ideas I had into actual code (eg. the glowing grid on the index.html page, the floating photo on the aboutme.html page, etc.)</p>
            <p>Here's a screenshot of how I was able to use some of the prompts to create some cool features:</p>
