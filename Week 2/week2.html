            <h2>Box-Making</h2>
            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Section Image">
            <p>I had a few designs ideas for my box. We had been shown some basic no-lid box ideas in class, and those seemed great, but I wanted something more unique for my project. So, I came up with the idea of making a nice large box with 2 rows of 3 drawers.</p>

            <p>In the process to ideate, I thought that I would use parts of the useless box that we had designed in class, as this was a simple box with an open top and 4 sides that could be used as a drawer. (insert image of useless box here)</p>

            <p>To make the sections for the shelves to go in the box onto which the drawers would sit, I thought that I could make areas on the walls of the box that would be scored by the laser cutter so there is a 'ridge' for cardboard pieces to sit on easily: (insert image here)</p>

            <p>HOWEVER, after spending substantial time on this idea, I pivoted massively to try and make a box more reflective of my project. This made me want to make a: SKATEBOARD SHAPED BOX!</p>
            <div class="sub-content-box">
                <h3>The inspiration</h3>
                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Boosted board inspiration">
                <p>This was the initial inspiration for the shape of my box: a boosted board. This seemed like it was long and wide enough (compared to a regular skateboard) to fit most of my stuff. To be honest, it also looked better as a 2D shape than a regular skateboard.</p>
                <p>I then imported this same image into Fusion 360 as a canvas and then traced out the basic shape of the skateboard using the sketch tool. Once I had done this, I used the 'offset' tool to make a border around the base that would act as the walls of the box. Once making the sketches, I exxtruded everything to make it look like this:</p>
                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Curved box design">
                <p>However, as you can see, the one thing that made it look good was the one thing that made it impossible to make: the curvature. After an extensive discussion with Bobby, I realized that the Laser Cutter would not be able to create the curvature of the walls I would need to have it wrap around the base well. This makes sense, since the laser cutter can only print 2D shapes with uniform thickness & straight shapes. We tried many features in Fusion, such as splitting the body, trying to make it into a flat 'sheet metal' body, etc, but none of these worked and it was simply getting too complicated to figure out. We could have cut a simple large rectangle and have uniform rasterized cuts on the surface to make it easy to simply bend, but it would have taken too much effort to glue it together.</p>

                <p>As a result, I completely uprooted my design and instead of having curved bases, I instead made the entire design mostly out of rectangles. I created entirely new parameters (below), and made a rectangular base that looked somewhat like a skateboard:</p>

                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Rectangular skateboard base design">

                <p>After this, I followed a <a href="youtube-link-here" target="_blank">youtube tutorial</a> on trying to add 'teeth' to the design so I could make the walls easily slot onto the base:</p>

                <p>I also wanted to have some cool designs on the sides of the box. The idea I had was to have my name on one side of the box, and the other side have the Harvard Shield on it. The name was simple enough, all I had to do was create a new sketch, add a text box, and modify it to my liking:</p>

                <p>The Veritas Shield, however, was not so simple. I could not simply trace out all the elements from the shield myself as that would be extremely time consuming. As a solution to the complication of tracing, I found a method to convert a PDF into a usable sketch in Fusion.</p>

                <p>This involved finding a PDF of the shield and importing it into AutoCAD. Once it imports, it is able to trace out the features of the PDF (provided it is not a mapping of a pixel photo), and then lets you export a DXF file of the design:</p>

                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="AutoCAD shield tracing">

                <p>Once I created the DXF file, I imported it into my Fusion 360 design, which then allowed me to move it around, scale it, and adjust it until it reached a point of my liking:</p>

                <p>So, by largely using the sketch tool, I was able to create a good looking design of the skateboard box:</p>

                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Final skateboard box design">

                <p>The walls:</p>

                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Box walls design">

                <p>I also added these small skateboard-style handles to the sides of the box that were a nice detail I thought was fitting for the entire project:</p>

                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Skateboard handles detail">

                <p>All I had to do now was to create a new sketch, create projections of each side individually in each sketch, and then export each sketch as a DXF that contained the designs. You can also download these files to see for yourself.</p>

                <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="DXF exports">

                <p>Now, it was simply a matter of making sure the laser cutter processed the design correctly, and I was able to cut out the walls for my box!</p>

                <p>Once cut, all I had to do was join the walls together at the teeth linkages (I used hot glue), let it dry, and voila! My skateboard-shaped box was ready!</p>

            <h2>Modelling a new object: A Coffee Cup Lid</h2>
            <p>I enjoy drinking coffee a lot and often have some extra mug lids (such as these) lying around. Here's how it looks:</p>

            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Coffee mug lid reference">

            <p>I first had to measure some basic dimensions:</p>

            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Lid measurement 1">
            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Lid measurement 2">
            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Lid measurement 3">

            <p>I then created some basic circles in fusion, and extruded them to different heights (similar to the actual dimensions of the lid):</p>

            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Basic circles and extrusions">

            <p>Then, I tried to emulate the top of the coffee lid by creating an ellipse to simulate the change in thin/thick that is on the top of the lid. Once I made the sketch, I extruded it:</p>

            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Ellipse extrusion">

            <p>I then used the draft tool to create the rising angle towards the area where the coffee actually comes out of:</p>

            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Draft tool application">

            <p>I then used the fillet tool to smooth out some edges:</p>

            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Fillet smoothing">

            <p>I also then created some sketches to add some more details to the top of the lid, extruded them, and used the fillet tool to smooth out the circles:</p>

            <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Additional details and smoothing">

            <p>All of this helped me create the final design:</p>

            <h2>Object 2: A Gear</h2>
            <p>I saw a bunch of gears lying around the PS70 Lab and wondered if I could model one similar to those.</p>

            <p>I had some relative idea on how to create gears, but I wanted to be able to create a fully symmetrical and actually 3D-printable design of the gear.</p>

            <p>Intitially, before I found the YouTube tutorial, I was ardously creating the individual teeth of the gear by creating sketches attached to a circle that I had created. I tried using the pattern toon, mirror tool, and similar ones that I was used to, but I was not able to get far:</p>
            <img src = "your-photo.jpg" alt = "Initial gear design">

            <p> In frustration, I found a youtube tutorial on how to make a rack-and-pinion system, and managed to create both the rack and pinion. It was arguably much, much easier to quickly create a gear using the python tool Fusion 360 has built-in.</p>
            <p> Using the tutorial, I was quickly able to make a much better design:</p>
