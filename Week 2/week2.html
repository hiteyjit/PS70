            <p>I had a few designs ideas for my box. We had been shown some basic no-lid box ideas in class, and those seemed great, but I wanted something more unique for my project. So, I came up with the idea of making a nice large box with 2 rows of 3 drawers.</p>

            <p>In the process to ideate, I thought that I would use parts of the useless box that we had designed in class, as this was a simple box with an open top and 4 sides that could be used as a drawer. (insert image of useless box here)</p>

            <p>To make the sections for the shelves to go in the box onto which the drawers would sit, I thought that I could make areas on the walls of the box that would be scored by the laser cutter so there is a 'ridge' for cardboard pieces to sit on easily: (insert image here)</p>

            <p>HOWEVER, after spending substantial time on this idea, I pivoted massively to try and make a box more reflective of my project. This made me want to make a: SKATEBOARD SHAPED BOX!</p>
