        <h3>This week was quite fun: we learnt how to create 3D models, understood Prusa Slicer (to convert our 3D designs into actual 3D prints), and also learnt how to use various scanning software to scan real-life objects and generate their 3D models!</h3>

            <h2>Part 1: 3D Scanning</h2>
            <p>Amongst the variety of tools we explored today, one of them included using 3D scanners to scan objects around us</p>
            <p>There were two tools I learnt how to use: photogrammetry applications (more specifically, PolyCam), and more larger handheld LIDAR devices (RevoPoint)</p>
            
            <h3>Photogrammetry</h3>
            <p>Polycam was an interesting tool shown to us by the Professor. He told us how it can help us scan everyday objects and items, and it seemed to be an interesting method to to quickly scan objects</p>
            <p>Because it seemed to intuitive to use, I gathered a few of my friends and we scanned each other. Literally. Using PolyCam, one of us stood as still as possible and another would walk around us and take ~100 photographs using PolyCam</p>
            <p>Using the in-built Polycam software, it then joined everything together, and voila! We got a 3D scanned version of me!</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Joey3d.png" alt="Me as a 3D Model">
                <p class="image-caption">Me as a 3D Model in Polycam</p>
            </figure>
            <p>However, this was not the only step – I was not done just after this. Polycam had messed up one aspects while scanning everything: There were remnants of the tripod stands I was resting my hand on while getting the scan taken</p>
           
            <figure>
                <img src="tripod_issue.png" alt="Visible tripod artifacts">
                <p class="image-caption">The visible tripod remnants</p>
            </figure>

            <p>Additionally, (and quite annoyingly) PolyCam's free version did not let me export the scan into a .stl or .obj file (the two formats that could have been read by Fusion 360) – it only let me download a '.glb' file. As a result, I couldn't directly import my scan into Fusion, and instead had to make use of... <bold>BLENDER</bold>!</p>
            <p>Blender seemed pretty straightforward, but I had to go somewhat into the documentation to understand how I could patch up the issue. Since I knew I had to export this file as an STL (as blender could not export native Fusion 360 files like .f3d), I decided to mess around with Blender and try to do the majority of my 3D object editing here this time.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">Importing the .glb file into Blender</p>
            </figure>

            <p>I searched up a few basic Blender tutorials and understood some low-level tools that I could quickly learn. For the context of editing the 3D model of myself, Mesh, extrude to Cursor, and the disolve options seemed particularly useful.</p>

            <p>First, I selected the parts of my hands that were an issue, and then I dissolved them:</p>
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

            </figure>
    
            <p>I could then export this file from Blender as a .stl and into Fusion if I needed to. I printed this too (see below)!</p>
            <p>Here's the 3D model if you'd like to play around with it too:</p>

            <h3>Some learnings after using Polycam</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use objects that have a natural color difference to them: Polycam is not able to pick up subtle surface differences as well as the human eye, so it is best to use objects that have a high variation in color and texture</li>
                <li>The object being scanned needs to remain really still: when we were scanning human subjects, we ended up messing up quite a few times because either someone's hand or face moved, messing with Polycams references and hence messing up the patching together. Some faces were quite warped and had werid depths to them becauase even small minor movements messed Polycam up</li>
                <li>Good lighting conditions: Poor lighting made it difficult for Polycam to accurately capture details and textures, leading to some weird scans in the beginning</li>
                <li>Take as many photos as possible: Polycam's software does a good job in telling you when and where to take the photo, but its a good practice to take as many as possible so as to enable extra reference points for the software to work with than to realize later you're missing crucial angles</li>
                <li>Consistent distance: Moving too close or too far while taking photos confuses the software's ability to stitch the images together properly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3D Scanning pt 2: Messing around with Revopoint</h2>
            <p>After experimenting with Polycam, I also got the chance to try out the Revopoint 3D scanner. This was a more professional-grade scanning tool compared to the phone-based Polycam app.</p>

            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="revopoint.jpeg" alt="Messing around with the scanner" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                <p class="image-caption">Messing around with the Revopoint Scanner</p>
            </figure>

            <p>I believe the Revopoint scanner uses some form of LIDAR, which was different from Polycam's photogrammetry approach (where it built 3D models from multiple 2D images). Additionally, I was able to see real-time feedback on how my scan was going while I was scanning it.</p>

            <p>I first tried scanning a pair of sunglasses with the Revopoint scanner:</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="glasses.jpg" alt="Attempting to scan sunglasses" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">Attempting to scan sunglasses</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>But this proved to be quite challenging. The transparent and reflective nature of the lenses made it nearly impossible for the scanner to properly capture the surface. The scanner would either completely miss parts of the lenses or create distorted geometry where the reflections were most prominent. I even tried to add circular reference stickers onto the lenses to see if it could help, but then the scanner just picked those up.</p>
            
            <p>After the unsuccessful attempt with the sunglasses, I decided to try scanning my hat instead. While this seemed like it would be an easier object to scan at first, it came with its own set of challenges.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="hat1.jpg" alt="First attempt to scan my cap" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">First attempt to scan my cap</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            

            <p>As I tried this, I realized that it was quite difficult to get a real '3d' scan of the hat. Either I could only scan the top or only the bottom. If I tried combining the two scans in the Revopoint software, it just wouldn't work.</p>
            <p>Additionally, even when I tried scanning one side at a time, the scanner struggled with picking up some of the details. I'm guessing this was since the background behind the hat matched its white color. Regardless, sometimes the scans were quite noisy.</p>


            <div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="hatscan.jpg" alt="Noisy scan of the hat">
                    <p class="image-caption">Noisy scan of the hat</p>
                </figure>

                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="hatcombine.jpg" alt="Attempting to combine two hat scans">
                    <p class="image-caption">Attempting to combine top and bottom scans of the hat</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>When this didn't end up working, I tried to come up with a way to scan the hat's sides simulataneously instead of having to take individual scans.<p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="hat2.jpg" alt="First attempt to scan my cap" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">My solution: spinning the had while it is suspended!</p>
                </figure>
            </div>     

            <p>This gave somewhat decent results, but there was still a lot of denoising necessary. In the end, I wasn't able to get a fully-perfect scan of my hat, but at least I got something!</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="hatscan2.png" alt="The best scan of my hat I could get" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

                </figure>
            </div> 

            
            <p>Some key differences I noticed between Revopoint and Polycam:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Revopoint scanner could capture much finer details</li>
                <li>I could see the 3D model being built in real-time as you scan</li>
                <li>I could mess around with some of the exposure settings in the software directly, which made some of the depth-scanning a little easier</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Part 2: 3D Printing</h2>
            <p>For this, I wanted to 3D print something I couldn't have made through either the CNC machine or the laser cutter.</p>
        
            <p>After discussing some ideas with Bobby, I was conflicted between designing either a structure that could snap together, or create an interlinking system that is already joined once it is 3D printed.</p>
            <p>Eventually (and mainly because I wanted a cool fidget toy), I decided to make a chain that has a ball on it that can roll around but always stay on the chain.</p>
            <p>This was my idea:</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="idea.jpg" alt="Sketch of my chain idea" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">My initial sketch of the chain idea</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>It seemed doable, so I hopped into Fusion to see what I could come up with</p>

            <p>First, I created a basic sketch of what the chain's monomer would look like</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="chainshape.png" alt="Sketch of the chain monomer" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">Basic sketch of the chain monomer</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Then, I extruded this into a thickness that could theoretically be sturdy enough:</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="extruded.png" alt="Extruded chain monomer" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">Extruded chain unit</p>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Then, I made a copy of this unit and rotated it by 90˚. I brought both shapes together and ensured that they intersected with each other:</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="linked.png" alt="Two chain units rotated and intersecting" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">Two chain units intersecting</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Then, I used made a copy of these two units and did the same thing where I brought the new 2 units and intersected them while ensuring their walls were not fusing together:</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="morelinks.png" alt="Four chain units linked together" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">Four chain units linked together</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Using the Rectangular Pattern tool, I created many more units of these, and ensured they joined well together. In order to ensure they joined while not merging their walls, I had to rotate some of them slightly:</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="pattern.png" alt="Chain units created using rectangular pattern" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <p class="image-caption">Chain units created using Rectangular Pattern Tool</p>
                </figure>
                <figure style="flex: 1;">

                    <p class="image-caption">Chain units linked together</p>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Once the main chain was done, all I had to do was create some basic rectangles to finish it off. I created two identical rectangles to attach the ends of the chain to, and created a cube with a hole in it that I filleted the edges off to make it into a donut/sphere shape.</p>
            
            <p>After all that, I joined them onto the chain, and made sure that the hole of my donut sphere was not fused with any of the chain units</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="extramods.png" alt="Final chain design with end pieces and sphere" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Importing it into PrusaSlicer was pretty straighforward, and I didn't have to mess around much with the settings. What appeared to work for me was the "0.15mm SPEED" preset.</p>
            <p>I had to adjust the support materials slightly, and I ended up choosing the "Everywhere" option, where the generated supports were the ones attached to the base plate of the 3D printer. This was a slight mistake, since it generated a LOT of supports (almost 40% of the print), but it wasn't anything I couldn't evenetually remove. It just took a lot of time :,) </p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

            <h3>And now, off to the 3D Printer!</h3>

            </div>

            <h3>The Result</h3>
            <p>After about 4.5hrs, the prints were complete! I printed the ball-chain model, and a small version of the scan of myself from earlier! Both came out pretty well, but there were really a LOT of supports.</p>

            <p>Although it was pretty easy getting the supports off my mini action-figure, the real task was getting them off the complex chain-ball print. I had to be careful to get the supports off from the print without breaking the actual chain.</p>
            <p>Prof. Melenbrink's advice ended up working best: I used a flat-head screwdriver and just broke as many of the supports as I could. Eventually, I was able to use the screwdriver to get in the space between where the supports were attached to the model, and then they easily started coming off: </p>

        <h2>Part 3: Final Project Planning</h2>
        <p>I mainly wanted to think about the major components I would need for my Electric Skateboard. I was chatting with Prof. Melenbrink about this a few days ago, and he showed me a brushless motor system that appeared to connect to a regular drill battery. Since these batteries could likely power one motor best, I have to figure out a way to turn 2 wheels at a time with it.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Although this is pretty basic, it revolves around the sort of idea I wanted to have: a singular motor system mounted to the board that could then have a gear/axle connection system to power the wheels.</p>
        <p>From my undersanding, most of the basic materials could be available in-house. However, some of the main components, i.e the things that would actually power the skateboard, would need to be sourced externally</p>
        <p>Here's a rundown of what I could anticipate</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Component</th>
                <th>Price</th>
                <th>Source & Description</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Skateboard Base</td>
                <td>N/A</td>
                <td>Will be made out of wood: can be sourced from within the PS70 lab using the woodcutter & gluing multiple cuts together</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Trucks and Wheels</td>
                <td>~$27.50</td>
                <td>Amazon; Will need to be modified to fit with the brushless Motor</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Brushless Motor, ESC System and 1x Wheel kit</td>
                <td>$80.00</td>
                <td>Prof. Melenbrink; He had mentioned a sourcer of these parts that could provide enough needed for one skateboard per kit</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Remote Control Tx & Rx</td>
                <td>$20.00</td>
                <td>Amazon; But some of these parts are likely to be available in the PS70 lab as well. A transmitter will be connected to a glove system (below) and will be recieved by a microcontroller that can then feed into the ESC from above. </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Stretch sensors for globe</td>
                <td>$10.00/sensor</td>
                <td>Microcenter; These could be directly sewn onto the glove and attached to a microncontroller with a transmitter that can send signals based on how much the hand is clenched or not. These sensors, however,are likely to be found in the lab too.</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Microcontrollers</td>
                <td>N/A</td>
                <td>ES32s & Arduinos available in the PS70 Lab.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Axles & Gears</td>
                <td>N/A</td>
                <td>Can be fabricated in the PS70 Lab. These will likely need to be designed and fitted according to the specification of motor and wheels that will be obtained.</td>
              </tr>
